            <li>an assignment due at 12, so I couldn't nap</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <div>
            <p>So my friday basically, I woke up in the morning, around 12pm. Pretty early for me honestly
                usually I wake up pretty late because I tend to stay up late. I saw on tiktok recently that it
                might be <em>revenge bedtime procrastination</em>. You can watch it below. Anyways, I also got my second
                dose
                on friday, at around 3pm. Once I got back home, I was so tired and really wanted to take a nap, but I
                couldn't
                b/c I had a assignment due at 12 that I had to finish so I had to suck it up and push through. But, so
                far, no symptons from the vaccine
                and I felt pretty good overall, just a little tired which is probably just from my sleeping habits. Yeah
                just finished my assignment and went to bed pretty early.

        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <div>
            <p> Saturday was the worst. the night before I went to bed early, I already knew a fever was coming. So at
                like 5am in the morning. I woke up my mom
                to as to find the thermometer lol. But yeah I checked and I definitely had a fever, and I was so cold so
                I slept with two blankets. Another thing. My sister also had a fever
                from the vaccine. But both of my parents were chillin, completely fine unfazed. Funny thing is, all my
                friends were fine with a slight headache. But honestly that was the worst
                fever I had in a while, I could keep my head straight, and the sleep was just bad, I just kept tossing
                and turning. The whole day, I spent it in bed and did not do anything except just watch
                a new episode of my hero academia in the morning.

        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <div>
            <p> Sunday was a little better, no more fever so that was good. Head felt a little dizzy, kind of felt
                hungover if i knew what it felt like.
                Set an alarm to wake up at 10 but ended up waking up at 2 :P. I tried but we will get there! Yeah ended
                watching LCS finals before I got any work done because
                I am so muhc more productive at night or when it's due in the next hour. Horrible habit but that's just
                how it is. Then I had GBM/initiation for the next few hours.
                Then I ate dinner, dinner was good had fish because I did not have an appetite the day before due to the
                fever. Then I had a team meeting. Group for CSE 110 pretty chill overall.
                We played codenames, that was fun. Now I'm finishing up this assignment.
