    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <div>
    <p>So my friday basically, I woke up in the morning, around 12pm. Pretty early for me honestly
        usually I wake up pretty late because I tend to stay up late. I saw on tiktok recently that it 
        might be <em>revenge bedtime procrastination</em>. You can watch it below. Anyways, I also got my second dose
        on friday, at around 3pm. Once I got back home, I was so tired and really wanted to take a nap, but I couldn't 
        b/c I had a assignment due at 12 that I had to finish so I had to suck it up and push through. But, so far, no symptons from the vaccine
        and I felt pretty good overall, just a little tired which is probably just from my sleeping habits. Yeah 
        just finished my assignment and went to bed pretty early.

        <div>
        <p> Saturday was the worst. the night before I went to bed early, I already knew a fever was coming. So at like 5am in the morning. I woke up my mom
            to as to find the thermometer lol. But yeah I checked and I definitely had a fever, and I was so cold so I slept with two blankets. Another thing. My sister also had a fever
            from the vaccine. But both of my parents were chillin, completely fine unfazed. Funny thing is, all my friends were fine with a slight headache. But honestly that was the worst
            fever I had in a while, I could keep my head straight, and the sleep was just bad, I just kept tossing and turning. The whole day, I spent it in bed and did not do anything except just watch
            a new episode of my hero academia in the morning.

        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <div>
        <p> Sunday was a little better, no more fever so that was good. Head felt a little dizzy, kind of felt hungover if i knew what it felt like.
            Set an alarm to wake up at 10 but ended up waking up at 2 :P. I tried but we will get there! Yeah ended watching LCS finals before I got any work done because
            I am so muhc more productive at night or when it's due in the next hour. Horrible habit but that's just how it is. Then I had GBM/initiation for the next few hours. 
            Then I ate dinner, dinner was good had fish because I did not have an appetite the day before due to the fever. Then I had a team meeting. Group for CSE 110 pretty chill overall. 
            We played codenames, that was fun. Now I'm finishing up this assignment.
